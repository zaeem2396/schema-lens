# Linter Notes

The remaining linter errors are **false positives** and expected for Laravel packages:

1. **`env()` function** - This is a Laravel helper function available at runtime
2. **Laravel Facades** (`Illuminate\Support\Facades\*`) - These are resolved at runtime via Laravel's service container
3. **Laravel Command methods** - Magic methods like `argument()`, `option()`, `info()`, etc. are provided by Laravel's Command base class

These errors will **not** affect the functionality of the package when installed in a Laravel application. The `phpstan.neon` configuration file helps suppress these when running static analysis tools.

## Running in Laravel

When this package is installed in a Laravel application via Composer, all dependencies and Laravel framework classes will be available, and these "errors" will disappear.

## Static Analysis

If you're running PHPStan or similar tools, use the provided `phpstan.neon` configuration file:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```
